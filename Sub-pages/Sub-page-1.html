                people can solve important problems and come up with creative solutions that affect many facets of life.
                Coding offers countless opportunities, from designing educational platforms that make learning
                accessible to all people to inventing software that streamline healthcare processes. It gives people the
                ability to realize their ideas, work through challenging issues, and enhance many people's quality of

                in the connected world of today. The world is becoming a more advanced and inclusive environment for
                everyone as more people learn to code, increasing our collective power to effect positive change and
