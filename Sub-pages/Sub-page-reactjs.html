            <h2>ReactJs</h2>
            <p>Facebook created the JavaScript framework ReactJS to help developers create user interfaces, especially
                for single-page apps where a smooth user experience is crucial. React makes code more efficient and
                manageable by enabling developers to design reusable user interface components. Its implementation of
                the virtual DOM improves efficiency by reducing direct manipulation of the actual DOM. Complex
                application development and debugging are facilitated by React's unidirectional data flow and state
                management features. It is frequently used in contemporary web development to create responsive and
                dynamic user interfaces.</p>
