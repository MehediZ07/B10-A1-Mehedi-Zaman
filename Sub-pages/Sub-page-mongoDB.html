            <h2>MongoDb</h2>
            <p>NoSQL database MongoDB is renowned for its scalability and versatility. MongoDB allows for changeable
                schemas since it stores data in documents that resemble JSON, unlike conventional relational databases.
                Because of this, it's a great option for applications that need to store a variety of intricate data
                structures. Because of its easy scalability and excellent performance due to its document-oriented
                design, MongoDB is a popular choice for contemporary applications that need to handle massive amounts of
                data and quick development cycles.</p>
