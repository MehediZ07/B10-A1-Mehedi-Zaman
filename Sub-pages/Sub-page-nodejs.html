            <h2>NodeJs</h2>
            <p>A runtime environment called Node.js makes it possible to use JavaScript for server-side programming.
                Node.js, which is based on the V8 JavaScript engine in Chrome, enables programmers to design scalable
                and fast applications. Because of its efficient and appropriate nature for real-time applications such
                as chat servers, online games, and collaboration tools, it employs an event-driven, non-blocking I/O
                paradigm. The development process is streamlined by developers' access to a large ecosystem of libraries
                and modules through the usage of npm (Node Package Manager).</p>
