            <h2>Cascading Style Sheets</h2>
            <p>A style sheet language called CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to manage how web pages are presented
                and laid out. CSS is used to impart styles to HTML elements, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and
                placement, whereas HTML provides the structure. Because content and design can be kept apart, it is
                simpler to update and maintain the look of web sites. The most recent version of CSS3, which improves
                both the user experience and visual attractiveness of websites, has features like animations,
                transitions, and flexible box layouts.</p>
