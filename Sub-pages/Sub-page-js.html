            <h2>JavaScript</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a programming language that is frequently used in web development to provide dynamic and
                interactive content. In contrast to HTML and CSS, which are mostly focused on design and structure,
                JavaScript enhances the functionality of online sites. It can handle events, validate forms, work with
                the Document Object Model (DOM), and use AJAX to talk to servers. JavaScript has become a vital tool for
                contemporary web developers because of frameworks and libraries for writing JavaScript, such React,
                Angular, and Vue.js, which have further streamlined and improved the creation of intricate online
                applications.</p>
